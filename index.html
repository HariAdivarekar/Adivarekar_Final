    <p><strong>Sucharitha Mandaloji would stay up late in the night  </strong> waiting for her husband, Rajendra Prabhu Mandaloji, 40, to call. It was a daily ritual for the couple to speak after he had finished a long day working as a carpenter in Qatar. Like so many other men and women, Mandaloji was a migrant worker who had left his home in India seeking a better life in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council), a migration route that has existed for over a century. And like most of those workers he had a family he had left behind, maintaining a vital lifeline with them over quick, daily phone calls.</p>  
  
    <p>That day, no call came through to his wife and two children, girls aged 6 and 12. The next morning, in September 2019, she would learn that Mandaloji had hung himself in the room he shared with five other workers.</p> 

    <p>His story and those of hundreds of other migrant worker deaths illustrate the harrowing conditions of the Kafala system, an age-old process of control over workers entering the middle eastern countries, in which companies often confiscate worker's passports, withhold salaries, and terminate their employment without giving them their dues. Added to this are some of the most extreme outdoor working conditions in the world, with temperatures and humidity crossing safe thresholds for human beings for 4-5 months in the year.</p>
        
    <p>“Extreme conditions start from where they live, their place of rest. The ACs are not cleaned properly, living quarters are cramped with many people sharing the same bathrooms. There aren't enough storage facilities for their food and they are forced to eat stuff that they are used to ethnically and natively. On top of that they also live pretty far from where they work so they have long commutes. These are the factors outside the worksite,” said Vani Saraswati, the Director of Projects at <a href="https://www.migrant-rights.org/">migrant-rights.org</a>, a multinational non profit. Saraswati was quick to point out that most data around worker deaths and suicides in the GCC are limited and often incomplete.</p> 
   

    <blockquote><p>“They're paid less than they're promised, so they're in conditions of debt bondage and they're often unable to send money home to their families who are depending on that money. This places an enormous strain, not only on their physical health, but on their mental health as well.” - Nick McGeehan, <a href="https://fairsq.org/">FairSquare</a></p></blockquote>

    <p>According to data received through RTIs (Right to Information) filed with India's embassies in the Middle East, between the years of 2015-2019, a total of 23,977 Indians died in the six countries that comprise the GCC. Of those 1,837, or almost 7.7% were by suicide. Data gathered by India's Ministry of External Affairs shows that there are almost 9 million Indians living in the GCC.</p>

    <p>Despite complaining repeatedly about his dire situation, Mandaloji was ignored or berated by his bosses. He found himself sinking deeper into a sense of hopelessness, when he wasn't even allowed to use his vacation time to go home and visit his family.His story and those of hundreds of other migrant worker deaths can be found on <a href="https://cardsofqatar.com/en/">Cards of Qatar</a> , a project started by Blankspot, a Swedish investigative journalism platform.</p>
        
    <p>Nick McGeehan, the co-founder of FairSquare, a UK based NGO that works with migrant workers in the GCC, shared the precarious financial situation that low income workers can often find themselves in. “Many migrant workers take out huge loans to come to the Gulf. They sell off land to pay for the recruitment fees that  they need to secure these jobs. These are huge sums of money. So there's a huge debt on the workers when they get there,” said McGeehan, “Then they're paid less than they're promised, so they're in conditions of debt bondage and they're often unable to send money home to their families who are depending on that money. This places an enormous strain, not only on their physical health, but on their mental health as well.”</p>

    <p>These violations of labor and human rights have been well documented and point to a more global cause. Many western multinational corporations use the middle east as a major hub for their expansions including some of America’s largest construction companies like Bechtel and Halliburton. </p>
    
    <p>“The main reason lots of Western multinationals and multinationals from other regions of the world are in the Gulf is because of the potential opportunities for very large scale contracts that offer a good (profit) margin. You have governments that are running major budget surpluses and they want to diversify their economies,” shared James Lynch, who worked as the Secondary Secretary (Political) for press and public affairs at the UK Embassy in Doha (Qatar) between 2007-2010. Lynch has been engaging with policy around migrant worker rights for the last decade.He added, “Often the western companies are in the role of consultants or project managers or program designers that aren't necessarily the people doing the actual building. It's much less risky to be involved in the design side, the consultant side, if something goes wrong, for delays, for health and safety.”</p>

    <p>This is a complex global issue, with many counter narratives. But even a single death of a migrant worker can have a seismic effect on the lives of their loved ones, back in their home countries. They could be aged parents, a young family or a newborn baby, left bereft without a parent, often the primary earner. While it is important to understand how many worker lives were lost to suicides in the GCC, we also need to pay attention to what can be done to prevent such tragedies. According to McGeehan this is going to be a hard road towards easily accessible mental health provisions for migrant workers.</p> 
    
    <p>“To prevent suicides and improve mental health we would need campaigns to destigmatize the issue,” said McGeehan who added, “We're still trying to ensure that they get access to physical health services. We haven't even begun to go out to the critical issue of mental health. It's still seen as secondary.”</p>
